## Experimentation

### Selecting a Classification Model

** Let us try out a few Classification Models without any Dimensionality Reduction and select the best one for future experimentation. **
<ol>
<li>Logistic Regression (Accuracy = 0.662)</li>
<li>Support Vector Classifier (Accuracy = 0.663)</li>
<li>Decision Tree Classifier (Accuracy = 0.562)</li>
<li>Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier (Accuracy = 0.611)</li>
</ol>

** NOTE: Python Implementation for the above can be found in the Classification Models Directory **

### Dimensionality Reduction

Yet to be done.......
